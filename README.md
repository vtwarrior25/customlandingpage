# customlandingpage
 A custom homepage/landing page created using basic Javascript and HTML.

## A Sample Image Of the Current Version:
![](/9ICJXhruaw.png)

## How to Adapt For Your Use Case:
Clone this repository, or at least download [index.html](index.html) and [blackbackground.css](blackbackground.css).
Next, open index.html with a text editor, and navigate to the div with an id of *linkssection*.
Each *\<a\>* tag will contain an *href* field, where you put the URL you want to link to. Between the *>* and the *<* on that line is where you would add the text that would appear for the link, like how this link says "Google": [Google](https://google.com).


## Future Improvements:
- [ ]  Make the page format itself correctly at all resolutions
- [ ]  Find a better way to get the weather instead of using a png
- [ ]  Add more URLs
